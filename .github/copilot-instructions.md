# Copilot Instructions for d:\Python Codes

## Project Overview
This workspace contains Python scripts organized by chapters (CH 1, CH 2, CH 3) and standalone files. Each chapter directory contains problem-focused scripts, likely for educational or practice purposes.

## Directory Structure
- `CH 1/`: Contains `problem1.py` to `problem5.py` (individual problems)
- `CH 2/`: Contains `arithmatic.py` and a `readme` with operator documentation
- `CH 3/`: (empty or not yet populated)
- `first.py`: Standalone script

## Key Patterns & Conventions
- Each chapter groups related problems; scripts are self-contained and do not import from other chapters.
- Operator usage and basic Python syntax are documented in `CH 2/readme`.
- No external dependencies or build tools detected; scripts are run directly with Python.
- No test files or frameworks present; correctness is likely verified by direct execution and inspection.
- No advanced architecture (e.g., classes, modules, services) detected; code is procedural and focused on small tasks.

## Developer Workflows
- **Run a script:**
  ```powershell
  python <script_path>
  # Example:
  python "d:\Python Codes\CH 2\arithmatic.py"
  ```
- **Edit or add problems:**
  - Place new scripts in the appropriate chapter folder.
  - Follow the naming convention: `problemN.py` for new problems.
- **Refer to operator documentation:**
  - See `CH 2/readme` for arithmetic operator usage.

## Integration Points
- No cross-file imports or external APIs detected.
- No configuration or environment files present.

## Example Patterns
- Arithmetic operations are explained in `CH 2/readme` and used in `arithmatic.py`.
- Scripts are short and focused on a single concept or problem.

## Recommendations for AI Agents
- Suggest code that is simple, direct, and focused on the problem at hand.
- Use examples from `CH 2/readme` for arithmetic operations.
- Maintain the chapter-based organization for new problems.
- Avoid introducing external dependencies or complex patterns unless requested.
